# Windows payload build and deployment

The fork's `main` branch contains the
MinGW PRX export fixes, patched library deployment script, and the experimental
guest kernel model. Build from `main` rather than the older
`integration/core-engine` checkout. In particular, that checkout's edited
`core/libs/prx/libc/CMakeLists.txt` names `Libc.cpp`, which does not exist.
The CMake generation failure prevents every later build and copy command.

Use PowerShell to create a separate checkout next to your current project.
Replace the example parent directory below with a directory that exists on
your computer. This leaves any uncommitted local work in the old checkout
intact. If you already cloned the fork, do not clone it again:

```powershell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\ps5translation"
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch main https://github.com/nahshongraham97/AnyPS5.git AnyPS5-fork
cd .\AnyPS5-fork
git remote -v
git status --short --branch
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --target libs relinker --parallel 4
```

The branch's GitHub Actions build uses WinLibs MinGW GCC 16.2.0, POSIX threads,
SEH, and the MSVCRT runtime. Use that toolchain when reproducing CI; keep the
compiler and any copied MinGW runtime DLLs from the same installation.
`cmake --build build --target libkernel` produces the **unpatched** PRX under
`build\core\libs\libs\unpatched`. It does not refresh
`build\core\libs\libs\libkernel.prx`. For a focused rebuild use
`--target patched_libkernel`; for deployment use `--target libs` so all
patched PRXs are refreshed. The deployment script rebuilds that target before
copying, and stops if the build fails. A matching hash on two deployed files
alone cannot establish that either contains the new export.

After a successful build, deploy the **patched** libraries, including their
`.sprx` copies. Set `$payloadRoot` to your real `CrispyDoom\payloads` path.
The path below matches the Crispy Doom v1.0-7.1.0 download under your user
Downloads folder. These PowerShell commands do not require changing the
script execution policy:

```powershell
$repoRoot = (Get-Location).Path
$payloadRoot = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'Downloads\crispy-doom-ps5-v1.0-7.1.0\CrispyDoom\payloads'
if (!(Test-Path -LiteralPath $payloadRoot -PathType Container)) { throw "Payload directory not found: $payloadRoot" }
$patchedDir = Join-Path $repoRoot 'build\core\libs\libs'
$librariesDir = Join-Path $payloadRoot 'libs'
$libraries = @(Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $patchedDir -Filter '*.prx' -File)
if ($libraries.Count -eq 0) { throw "No patched PRX files found in $patchedDir" }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $librariesDir -Force | Out-Null
foreach ($library in $libraries) {
    $name = [IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($library.Name)
    Copy-Item -LiteralPath $library.FullName -Destination (Join-Path $librariesDir "$name.prx") -Force
    Copy-Item -LiteralPath $library.FullName -Destination (Join-Path $librariesDir "$name.sprx") -Force
}
Write-Host "Deployed $($libraries.Count) patched libraries to $librariesDir"
```

Do not copy from `build\core\libs\libs\unpatched`: those binaries lack the
NID patching needed by converted ELF imports. Find the original ELF under
Downloads and run the audit against it:

```powershell
$elf = Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath (Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'Downloads') -Recurse -File -Filter 'crispy-doom.elf' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1
if (!$elf) { throw 'crispy-doom.elf was not found under Downloads; set $elf to its actual location.' }
python .\scripts\audit-elf-imports.py $elf.FullName $patchedDir
python .\scripts\audit-payload-startup.py $elf.FullName
```

If the ELF is outside Downloads, locate it with File Explorer and assign
`$elf = Get-Item 'its real path'`. A missing import report requires an
implementation and another build; the audit passing alone does not establish
runtime compatibility.
The startup audit reports SDK markers and possible raw `syscall` opcode
locations. A byte match is only a candidate until instructions are decoded.
For the current Crispy Doom ELF, its SDK CRT reads six `payload_args` fields
and executes kernel dependent initialization before `main`. The Windows
entry stub supplies none of the kernel facilities; the report deliberately
marks this combination as not runnable by the current Windows conversion.

## Regenerate a converted executable after rebuilding the libraries

The converted `.exe` contains its own startup stub. Deploying new PRXs does
not update a previously converted executable. A trace that prints
`Loading module:` comes from an older relinker build; the current stub prints
`Loading PRX:` and tries the NID export before the original symbol name. For
example, `sceSystemServiceHideSplashScreen` is implemented by
`libSceSystemService` and its patched NID is `Vo5V8KAwCmk`.

From the fork checkout, with `$elf` and `$payloadRoot` set as above, generate
a separate executable and test that file:

```powershell
$converted = Join-Path $payloadRoot 'crispy-doom-current.exe'
& .\build\core\relinker\relinker.exe --windows --windows-diagnostics --skip-syscall-check $elf.FullName $converted
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "Relinker failed: $LASTEXITCODE" }
& C:\WinLibs\mingw64\bin\gdb.exe -batch -q -x (Join-Path $payloadRoot 'trace.gdb') $converted
```

`--skip-syscall-check` only allows conversion of this known payload with raw
syscall instructions. Those instructions are not yet routed to the guest
kernel model. A later startup error or crash must be diagnosed separately;
this command does not make the payload safe to run past that point.
To distinguish imports that are merely present from those actually called
before the first frame, use the strictly fail-fast diagnostic procedure in
[Crispy Doom lazy trace](CrispyDoom-LazyTrace.md). It does not implement
missing imports, startup syscalls, video or input.
The `sigaction` export currently handles queries and simple dispositions for
the signals supported by the host bridge. It returns a guest error for
nonzero flags or signal masks, which cannot yet be honored; resolving this
import is not evidence of complete signal compatibility.

If `LoadLibraryExA` still fails on `libSceVideoOut.sprx` with Windows error 127,
capture the complete import tables and the files actually deployed. The error
means a dependent module could not provide a requested procedure; the GDB
trace alone does not identify which procedure or module. With the variables
from the deployment block still set, run:

```powershell
& C:\WinLibs\mingw64\bin\objdump.exe -p (Join-Path $librariesDir 'libSceVideoOut.sprx') | Select-String 'DLL Name:|vma:|ordinal:'
Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $librariesDir -File | Where-Object { $_.Extension -in '.sprx','.prx','.dll' } | Select-Object Name,Length,LastWriteTime
Get-FileHash (Join-Path $librariesDir 'libSceVideoOut.sprx'), (Join-Path $librariesDir 'libSceVideoOut.prx') -Algorithm SHA256
```

Check the named dependent libraries in the same payload directory for the
requested exports and record the full `objdump -p` output if the brief view
does not expose the failing symbol. Do not infer ELF startup success from a
successful Windows DLL load: the PS5 SDK `payload_args` startup contract and
guest machine-code syscall routing are still outstanding.

If you prefer to update the old checkout after saving your local edits, set
its `origin` to the fork and retain upstream as a separate remote:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/nahshongraham97/AnyPS5.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/boykopovar/AnyPS5.git
git fetch origin
```

If `upstream` already exists, skip `git remote add upstream`. Inspect
`git status --short --branch` before switching branches; a fresh clone above
avoids overwriting the edited CMake files.
